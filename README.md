Team Banana Split
Project Reflection
Summary

The goal of this project was to analyze the magist dataset, visualize the data, and extract meaningful insights that could support decision-making. It helped me connect technical skills with real-world problem-solving.

Languages and Libraries Used

SQL

Tableau

Working on this project strengthened my understanding of data analysis workflows. I also learned how important it is to communicate findings in a simple and structured way.

Challenges Overcame

At first, I struggled with inconsistent data formats and missing values. After trying different cleaning methods, I found a workflow that made the dataset much easier to work with.
I also had to learn how to connect SQL queries with Tableau efficiently, which took some trial and error but was worth it.

Additional Reflections

This project gave me more confidence in my ability to work in groups on data projects. It also reminded me that patience and curiosity are just as important as technical knowledge when working with data.
